  /**
   * A poller needs to be initialized by passing in at least the basic properties of the `PollOperation<TState, TResult>`.
   *
   * When writing an implementation of a Poller, this implementation needs to deal with the initialization
   * of any custom state beyond the basic definition of the poller. The basic poller assumes that the poller's
   * operation has already been defined, at least its basic properties. The code below shows how to approach
   * the definition of the constructor of a new custom poller.
   *
   * ```ts
   * export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, string> {
   *   constructor({
   *     // Anything you might need outside of the basics
   *   }) {
   *     let state: MyOperationState = {
   *       privateProperty: private,
   *       publicProperty: public,
   *     };
   *
   *     const operation = {
   *       state,
   *       update,
   *       cancel,
   *       toString
   *     }
   *
   *     // Sending the operation to the parent's constructor.
   *     super(operation);
   *
   *     // You can assign more local properties here.
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Inside of this constructor, a new promise is created. This will be used to
   * tell the user when the poller finishes (see `pollUntilDone()`). The promise's
   * resolve and reject methods are also used internally to control when to resolve
   * or reject anyone waiting for the poller to finish.
   *
   * The constructor of a custom implementation of a poller is where any serialized version of
   * a previous poller's operation should be deserialized into the operation sent to the
   * base constructor. For example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, string> {
   *   constructor(
   *     baseOperation: string | undefined
   *   ) {
   *     let state: MyOperationState = {};
   *     if (baseOperation) {
   *       state = {
   *         ...JSON.parse(baseOperation).state,
   *         ...state
   *       };
   *     }
   *     const operation = {
   *       state,
   *       // ...
   *     }
   *     super(operation);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @param operation - Must contain the basic properties of `PollOperation<State, TResult>`.

   * // Then, we define our Poller as follows:
   * export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, ResultType> {
