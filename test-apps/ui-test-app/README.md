# ui-test-app Test Application

The ui-test-app iModel.js test application provides an easy way to test the React components in the iModel.js UI packages, including the 9-zone components, along with other iModel.js packages.

## Development setup

To start the application, simply install its dependencies and run it:

1. Install the dependencies

  ```sh
  rush install
  ```

2. Build the application using `rush build`, or to rebuild ui-test-app, use `npm run build` in the `imodeljs\test-apps\ui-test-app` directory.

  ```sh
  rush build
  ```

3. There are two servers, a web server that delivers the static web resources (the frontend Javascript, translatable strings, fonts, cursors, etc.), and the backend RPC server that opens the iModel on behalf of the application. Start them both running locally in the `imodeljs\test-apps\ui-test-app` directory:

  ```sh
  npm run start:servers
  ```

4. Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome or Edge), and browse to localhost:3000.

5. You can rebuild any of the iModel.js packages independently using `npm run build` in the appropriate folder then refresh the browser to pick up those changes and restart the application.

## Snapshot file support

You can now open snapshot files using ui-test-app. These are the relevant environment variables to set before using `npm run start:servers`:

*	TESTAPP_SNAPSHOT_FILEPATH - set to folder containing .bim or .ibim files (required)
*	TESTAPP_START_WITH_SNAPSHOTS - set to 1 to start with File Open dialog (optional)

__Note:__ You must navigate to your snapshot folder the first time you use the File Open dialog. To open other files, click the "Home" button in the upper-left then click "Open Local File". You still need to sign-in.
